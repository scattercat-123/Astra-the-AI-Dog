## How does this work:

Here the side motor drives the whoe thing whih is connected on the bearing.

This motor, drives the hip joint of the leg.
For the knee motor, i have researched on many papers which claim when the motors is placed far from the hip join the torque provided by the hip joint is needed more so the battery gets drained fast. You can see the knee system here:
