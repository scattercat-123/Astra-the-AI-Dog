# Astra: The AI Quadruped dog
## What is this?
 - A dog which acts as a companion robot dog.
 - Uses Actuators with planetary gearbox and multiple sensor for advanced AI!
 - Using jetson nano orin super(raspberry pi using for testing)!!!

## Day 1: Research and starting fusion
I have already researched enough ðŸ˜­. imma start
Okay im using carbon fiber rods for the leg!
And for the foot im using a silicon molded ball thing :suspect:

A somewhat completed foot ðŸ¦¶

## Day 2: I dint show you something b4
I actually had started designing 2 ACTUATORS. One was using a [camera motor](https://shop.iflight.com/ipower-motor-gm5208-12-brushless-gimbal-motor-pro279?srsltid=AfmBOorSPDTZzSXuuPQEK-6dXlJDZKPpKBmCNM_RbTE9hdy-FQK5-I5s) - i forgot whats that called. but that only had 2.5kg/cm which i had observed after an entire day.
Faliure photo :( -

I was going to make like a planetary gearbox but nvm..
Then i thought i would use the eaglepower 90kv motor just like [Aaed Musa](https://www.aaedmusa.com/) and then i was gonna build a planetary gearbox. i was almost done but later i realised that it would become too expensive after me buying odrive s1's. So i went on alibaba and the chepaest thing which i found which has a encoder and driver built into it was this motor
THE GIM6010-8!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was the perfect motor because it had a stall torque of 11n.m and the motor was tested by someone over [here](https://hackaday.io/project/202366-the-unnamed-spider-bot/log/239789-steadywin-gim6010-8-stock-controller-vs-odrive-vs-tinymovr)
Also this has a driver and it has like planetary gaerbox in it. so this was perfect. and it was kinda cheap. bruh - 70$ ðŸ’¸
Can someone help me rob a bank ðŸ’°.. jkjk dont call 911
Yeah, wasted i gues 3-4 days on deciding a motor.

## Day 3-5: Designed something :)

If you can see these are gt2 belts. so like the motor will stay on the hip but drive the knee axis. this is actually usefull because i researh showed that the battery would drain faster if the motor was near the knee because of incraesed weight ðŸ¤“. so yeah

## Day 5-10: did very little stuff
Im very distracted
here is some final thingies. for all axis - knee, hip, abduction joint( aka moves your lige side to side.

So basically the leg was done!

## Day 10: Dont ask me why is this so complex..
Yeah i just realized it would be hard to 3d print and assemble some parts. so fixed mny issues!

## Day 11-13: Final Full dog design.
Today I designed my almost complete dog.
<img width="862" height="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f591f54-7b1a-448d-ab76-287098ec5f76" />

I also finished my overly expensive [BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tXSbPTXzO7x9RjKfoS4aTnTzwVyE0GcGUCTSj2ZbIsA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
Right now i am not adding sensor mounts and all to my dog since i will test my ai stuff and then add sensors and all for autmoated dog exploration.

I am not sure if it looks good. But remember to star my repo

## Day 11: Final stuff
Some final adjustments, submitted in highway pitstop channel.
